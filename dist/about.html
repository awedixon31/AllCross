          <h2 class="fs-5">What is cyclocross?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p class="text-secondary"> Typical cyclocross courses are 1.5- to 2-mile loops on a mix of paved and off-road surfaces over flat-to-rolling terrain. But what makes cross such a unique and challenging sport is that courses always include obstacles that force riders to dismount and run while carrying their bikes. It is a fusion of road and mountain with a sprinkle of bmx to equal intense fun and challenges that spark the love of riding!
            For example, most courses feature short, steep (often muddy) sections (who doesn’t like playing in the mud?).</p>
          <p class="text-secondary"> Also, courses include series of human-made barriers scattered around the course requiring riders to carry their bikes. It’s this combination of cycling, stunt riding, carrying, running and scrambling over obstacles that makes cyclocross so exciting, such a phenomenal workout and so crazy much fun!
            Cyclocross is a perfect intro into cycling for riders because it provides a fun, safe, and positive environment that allows to thrive at whatever level they are at. The sport also allows riders to develop further skills that can help in other cycling disciplines if they want to branch out. Cyclocross offers challenges in a fun way to build confidence and install the love of the bike. With courses being so spectator friendly, riders get support from the sidelines from family, friends, fellow riders, and fans. The environment of practices, races, and the sport in general is laid back, supportive, and fun to create a one of a kind experience for all riders.
