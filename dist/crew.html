            As a female in the male-dominated cycling world, I have firsthand experienced countless challenges yet the bike has
            taught me perseverance and determination. I have built and run national elite-level women's and junior race teams,
            organized countless community bike clinics/programs, ran kid's bike programs, sat on numerous boards and committees for
            cycling, advocated for better practices for juniors/women, and so much more. I have seen firsthand the way a bike can
            literally change and save one's life. From high levels of competitive racing to an everyday means of transportation,
            bikes are a unique thing that positively impacts individuals and communities. My wide range of experience with bikes
            from high levels to grassroots drives me to give opportunities and eliminate barriers to create a more diverse cycling
            culture that welcomes all and will allow people to find what the bike means to them. Cyclocross is an amazingly fun way
            to bring people together in an open welcoming environment that can build communities and get more people involved at all
            ages and levels. My drive is my passion to share bikes with everyone and be the change we all want to see.

            I grew up on a ranch in central Arkansas. My first experience with competition was running. I ran in college and ended
            up injured from over training in my first year. This was a devastating moment, but the injury led me to buy an old
            cyclocross bike. After racing in Colorado for 10 years I’ve returned to my roots in Arkansas. I’ve had the privilege of
            racing and riding my bike all over the world from some of the most iconic races like Leadville 100, Dirty Kanza 200, to
            the South African Absa Cap Epic stage race. I know firsthand how bikes can change lives.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary lead">I ride because I love exploring the land around me and my own physical limitations. I love to escape into the back roads
            of Arkansas, deep into the Ozark Mountains. However, I have come to see that it is the life long cycling friends that
            have made through riding my bike that has made all the difference to me over the years.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary lead">I currently live in Downtown Rogers Arkansas. I love this place. A great deal of my efforts in community development has
            been through cycling and its impacts on the community. I am passionate about building healthy, diverse, inclusive,
            communities. The bike is an incredible machine and a great tool to create a healthy culture in a community. Arkansas has
            a unique position right now to showcase what the bike can do for small towns.</p>
            <p class="text-secondary lead">I am excited about Allcross because it’s the type of grass roots movement in the cycling world that establishes the
            early history of what we are all about. What we value and who we value is established in movements like this. I want to
            be a part of the change. I want to hold steady to the values that Allcross represents, so we can create a healthy,
            diverse, and inclusive cycling community right here in NWA. Let's all ride bikes!

            I grew up in Lowell, Arkansas. I’ve been riding bikes since I was 11 years old. I started mountain biking right before
            the huge NWA cycling boom, so I picked a decent time to become hooked on the sport. In 9th grade, I started road bike
            racing partially due to constantly catastrophically injuring myself out of my school track and cross country running
            career. I won my first several races, including the Joe Martin Stage race (as a cat 5), and decided cycling was my new
            obsession. I raced constantly all through high school, into college, and up to the present day. I was lucky enough to be
            able to race elite levels in road, xc mountain bike, and cyclocross through those years. I learned a lot about myself,
            life, training, racing, and tactics while racing bikes all across the country and internationally. I took a bit of a
            hiatus from racing a few years back and decided to coach cycling. I coached for Breakaway Cycling Team and had a blast.
            I loved passing along all the skills and lessons I learned along the way. I really enjoy setting up awesome racecourses,
            which I am fortunate enough to have been able to do over the past few years. I’m currently a firefighter/EMT who loves
            to ride, run, backpack, and rock climb. Bikes are an amazing thing and can bring people together. Cyclocross is a great
            avenue to build grassroots and have fun!
